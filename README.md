# languages
This repository serves as a git submodule for [tt.bot][tt.bot repo] that serves the locale files without granting the translators the permissions to tamper with the main bot repository unknowingly.

## Adding languages
So you want to add your native language, huh?

### Prerequisites
- Some JS knowledge. Without it, you won't get anywhere.
- Basic understanding of how Discord works
- Basic understanding of how to control your computer

### How-to
1. Make a copy of `en.js` and rename it appropriately. The format is `xx-YY`, where the `xx` means the language, and the `YY` means the region.
2. Translate the strings into your native language.
3. Preferrably, double-check if everything looks right by launching your own tt.bot instance. 
4. Create a pull request.
5. ???
6. Profit

### FAQ
- **What is the context of the strings?**  
To see the context, run `tt.profile locale trans`.  
This will switch you to a special language that will show the term names instead of the actual strings. However, arguments are ignored and in some strings, you won't see what you want to see. If this is the case, go to [tt.bot's repository][tt.bot repo] and look for code similar to one of these:  
  ```js
  msg.t("TERM_NAME", args, moreArgs)
  ```
  ```js
  bot.i18n.getTranslation("TERM_NAME", "LOCALE", args, moreArgs)
  ```

- **What happens after my language is approved?**  
We will create a new team for your language and add you to the `tt-bot-dev` organization. That way, you don't have to fork the repository and you can commit to other branches. Pushing to `master` branch is restricted to maintainers for security reasons.
