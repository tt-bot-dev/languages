## Adding languages
So you want to add your native language, huh?  
First, you need some JS knowledge. Without it, you won't get anywhere.  
Next, copy en.js to your language file, and translate! If you have problems with getting the context, use `tt.profile locale trans` to get switched to a special locale that will show the raw term names for each command possible. You might possibly want to take a look at tt.bot's code (check for `msg.t("TERMNAME", "additional", arguments, "for the terms")` and `bot.i18n.getTranslation("TERMNAME", "LOCALE", "additional", arguments, "for the terms")`.  
You are done? If you want to double check, spin up a tt.bot instance with your language and check if everything looks right. Then, you can create a PR.  
We'll triple check that everything is right and that you aren't pulling a `config.token` to your language, then we will create a new team for your language and add you to the organization!  
That way, you don't need a fork anymore (pushing to `master` is restricted to maintainers because of above) and can create new branches.
